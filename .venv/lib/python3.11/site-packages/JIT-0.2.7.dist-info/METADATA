Description
toscawidgets2 (tw2) aims to be a practical and useful widgets framework that helps people build interactive websites with compelling features, faster and easier. Widgets are re-usable web components that can include a template, server-side code and JavaScripts/CSS resources. The library aims to be: flexible, reliable, documented, performant, and as simple as possible.

The JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit (thejit) is a javascript library that provides web standard based tools to create interactive data visualizations for the Web. It is pretty, interactive, and fast.

This module, jit, provides toscawidgets2 (tw2) widgets that render thejit data visualizations.

Sampling jit in the WidgetBrowser
The best way to scope out jit is to load its widgets in the devtools WidgetBrowser. To see the source code that configures them, check out jit/tw2/jit/samples.py

To give it a try you’ll need git, python, and virtualenvwrapper. Run:

$ git clone git://github.com/NocoldBob/jit.git
$ cd jit
(jit) $ pip install devtools
(jit) $ python setup.py develop
(jit) $ paster browser
…and browse to http://localhost:8000/ to check it out.
